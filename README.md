# Full Stack Open

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises of the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/)'s [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. The repository encompasses solutions from parts 0 to 9 of the course. Full Stack Open provides an excellent introduction to modern web development. The core course consists of parts 0 to 5, with additional parts that can be completed in any order thereafter.

## Course Content

### Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Applications
- This section covers the basics of web development and the advancements in web application development over the past few decades. Topics include web application structure, the HTTP protocol, developer tools, traditional web applications, AJAX, single-page applications, and JavaScript libraries.

### Part 1: Introduction to React
- This section introduces the React library and some essential JavaScript features necessary for understanding React.

### Part 2: Communicating with the Server
- This section continues the introduction to React, covering data rendering, data submission with HTML forms, fetching data from a remote backend server, and basic CSS styling.

### Part 3: Programming a Server with Node.js and Express
- This section focuses on implementing and deploying a simple REST API on the internet. The application is developed using Node.js and the Express library, with data stored in a MongoDB database.

### Part 4: Testing Express Servers and User Administration
- This section continues to focus on the backend, covering key topics such as writing unit and integration tests, and implementing user authentication and authorization.

### Part 5: Testing React Applications
- This section deals with testing React code and implementing token-based authentication.

### Part 6: Advanced State Management
- This section introduces the Redux library as a solution for managing the state of React applications. Redux provides a centralized state management solution, simplifying state updates, enhancing predictability, and facilitating debugging in complex React applications.

### Part 7: React Router, Custom Hooks, and Styling Applications with CSS and Webpack
- This section covers React Router as a way to divide the application into different views based on the URL. It also deals with custom hooks, various methods for styling React applications, and using Webpack.

### Part 8: GraphQL
- This section introduces GraphQL as an alternative to REST for communication between the browser and server. GraphQL allows clients to request precisely the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching, leading to more efficient and flexible APIs.

### Part 9: TypeScript
- This section introduces TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript offers static typing, enhancing code quality by catching errors at compile-time, improving code maintainability, and enabling better IDE support.
